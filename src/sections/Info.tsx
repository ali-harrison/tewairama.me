      Born amidst the rugged beauty of Bluff, New Zealand, in 2004, I was raised
      as a small-town kid with the ocean as my playground and the vibrant
      tapestry of Te Ao MƒÅori as my cultural backdrop. Growing up in this
      close-knit community, I developed a deep appreciation for the great
      outdoors and the wisdom of my ancestors.

      My journey continued in Rotorua, where I completed my high school
      education. This unique upbringing equipped me with a diverse set of skills
      and insights, empowering me to infuse my personal touch into everything I
      undertake. Now, I am on a quest to redefine the boundaries of design and
      development, merging creativity with innovation to craft experiences that
      resonate on a deeper level.
